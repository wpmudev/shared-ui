# Contributing

1. Install node. It's recommended to install `nvm` to switch between node versions.
2. Execute npm in root project folder `npm install` will install all needed packages in `node_modules` folder.
3. Execute `npm run dev` to start watching SCSS and JS files. The demo file will then automatically be served up by [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/). All changes made will automatically be watched and the page live reloaded when changes are made.

## Workflow

Do not commit on `development` or `master` branches. `development` is the code that will be used for beta testing. `master` should always be synced with the latest version.

- Create a new branch from `development` branch: `git checkout -b branch-name`. Try to give it a descriptive name. For example:
    * `new/modal-box` for new features
    * `enhance/floating-notification` for enhancements
    * `fix/header-padding-incorrect` for bugfixing
- Make your commits and push the new branch: `git push -u origin branch-name`
- File the new Pull Request against `development` branch
- Assign somebody to review your code.
- Once the PR is approved and finished, merge it in `development` branch.
- Delete your branch locally and make sure that it does not longer exist remote.

It's a good idea to create the Pull Request as soon as possible so everybody knows what's going on with the project from the PRs screen in Bitbucket.

## Scoping Styles & Scripts

In order to avoid conflicts with other versions of this library, we are using a versioned body class in the format `.sui-x-x-x`. This class is automatically generated by the `body-class` mixin which should wrap all scss in the project.

Any base styles should also include the `.sui-wrap` class. This class is used in place of the `.wrap` class for plugin admin pages to prevent any Shared UI specific styles from bleeding into the wp-admin menubar & sidebar.

## Updating the Shared UI Package

Requirements:

+ Must be a developer member of the [wpmudev organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/wpmudev/team/developers#members) on npm.
+ Must be on `master` branch with a clean working directory.

**Note:** Do not interact with any of the project's version numbers in a direct way. The following commands handle all aspects of releasing the next version. Once ran, they will auto update `package.json`, `scss/_variables.scss`, the body class in `index.html`, and the asset query strings with the next corresponding [semver](https://semver.org/) version. They will then build the new files, commit them, tag the release, and publish to npm.
